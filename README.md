### extracting data
First, I am going to extract data from the NIED site database. 
https://www.bosai.go.jp/e/research/database/earthquake.html

Then, I choose the K-NET tool. There, with an earthquake selected, I have two options
* "Download All Channels Data"
* "Download All Data" (ASCII or binary)

### script cleaner
Files will be in ascii or binary format, then I must check it and store data in an acurate format.

Data is saved as accelerations in the three different components; vertical (UD), and both horizontal. There is alsos wave data. Which in our case is not relevant.
